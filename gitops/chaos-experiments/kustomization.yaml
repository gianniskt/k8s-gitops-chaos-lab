# ESSENTIAL chaos experiments for sustainable observable impact
# Spaced experiments that trigger KEDA scaling and show dashboard metrics
resources:
  # Consolidated sustainable chaos schedules (includes all core experiments)
  - chaos-schedules.yaml
  
  # Monitoring integration
  - chaos-servicemonitor.yaml

# âœ… ESSENTIAL EXPERIMENTS:
# - pod-kill-simple (PodChaos with pod-kill action)
#   * Instantly kills one backend pod
#   * Demonstrates Kubernetes self-healing
# - dns-chaos-simple (DNSChaos)
#   * Causes DNS resolution errors for google.com
#   * Demonstrates network/DNS resilience
#
# Both experiments provide clear observable impact in Grafana
# with minimal complexity for demos/learning
